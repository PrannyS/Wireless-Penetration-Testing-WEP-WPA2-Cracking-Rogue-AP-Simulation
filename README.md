## üìå Overview  
This repository contains my submission for **Lab 4: Wi-Fi Security**, where I explored vulnerabilities in wireless networks, including:  
- Cracking WEP encryption  
- Cracking WPA2 encryption  
- Performing deauthentication attacks  
- Simulating rogue access points  

This project demonstrates **ethical hacking techniques** used in penetration testing for assessing and strengthening Wi-Fi security.

## üõ† Key Topics Covered  
- **Cracking WEP Encryption**: Used `aircrack-ng` to recover WEP keys by analyzing captured IVs.  
- **Breaking WPA2-PSK Encryption**: Captured WPA2 handshake and used dictionary attacks.  
- **Deauthentication Attacks**: Exploited CVE-2019-16275 to disconnect clients from a Wi-Fi network.  
- **Rogue Access Point Attack**: Set up a fake AP and captured victim traffic.

## üîç Methodology  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Cracking WEP Encryption**  
- Enabled **monitor mode** using `airmon-ng`.  
- Captured packets using `airodump-ng`.  
- Used **IVs** to decrypt the key with `aircrack-ng`.  

```bash
# Start monitor mode
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0

# Capture packets
sudo airodump-ng -w wep_capture wlan0mon

# Crack WEP key
sudo aircrack-ng -b XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX wep_capture.pcap
